## Overview

This article presents a hands-on blueprint for learning about recent advances in natural language processing through practical projects rather than theoretical study first. The covered topics include transformers, language models like BERT and GPT-2, evaluation benchmarks, and conversational interfaces.

## Getting Started

The author outlines an initial project list:

- Experiments with OpenAI's GPT-2 to understand language models
- Building an ML-powered chatbot to explore natural language understanding
- Creating a tool to transcribe and analyze audio conversations

The approach was deliberately open-ended, allowing for refinement as interests evolved.

## Playing Around with GPT-2

### Parody Twitter Bot

The author created a GPT-2 chatbot trained on tweets from multiple parody accounts, including personas of Queen Elizabeth, Lord Voldemort, Darth Vader, and Bored Elon Musk. The resulting bot account combined these personas into "@ai_gpt2."

### Understanding Transformers, BERT, and GPT-2

The author studied the theoretical foundations behind these models, noting that "both GPT and BERT are based off of the transformer architecture" but differ structurally—BERT uses only encoder blocks while GPT-2 uses only decoder blocks.

### Evaluating NLP Benchmarks

The author explored standard benchmarks like GLUE and SQuAD to understand how language models are evaluated. These benchmarks test different language aspects including entity recognition, question-answering, and coreference resolution.

## Practical NLU: Conversational Interfaces

### AI Voice Assistant

Following RASA's tutorial, the author built a voice-enabled assistant using open-source tools, exploring how developers approach conversational AI.

### Customer Service Chatbot

The author then experimented with Google's Dialogflow managed service, discovering it straightforward after understanding core concepts like intents and actions.

## Concluding Thoughts

The author emphasizes the importance of exploring breadth over depth initially, allowing for efficient learning within time constraints. Key observations include:

- Voice interfaces are gaining adoption, especially in emerging economies
- Natural language improvements will aid technology democratization
- We should remain realistic about current limitations despite recent hype
- RASA suggests "we are perhaps a decade away" from the highest level of conversational AI maturity

The author advocates for responsible innovation in language technology while continuing to document learnings publicly.
