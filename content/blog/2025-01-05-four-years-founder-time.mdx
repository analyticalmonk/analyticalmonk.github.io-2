## Overview

The startup experience offers opportunities to deepen understanding of lessons already learned. Three major insights emerged from the author's four-year journey as co-founder of Looppanel, a VC-backed remote startup operating across six continents:

- Timing matters
- Accept the past
- Good things take time

## Timing matters

The importance of timing manifests frequently in product prioritization decisions. Acting too early or too late can render efforts meaningless. The author notes that "a difference of a week can transform an initiative from vital to irrelevant," while moving too early to market—such as introducing AI features before mainstream acceptance—creates skepticism that later evaporates.

Looppanel benefited from pandemic timing. The company launched during lockdowns when remote research sessions became standard practice. Competitors with identical concepts struggled because insufficient remote research activity existed before 2020.

Personal timing also matters beyond logic. The author emphasizes that intuition sometimes provides better guidance than pure reasoning.

## Accept the past

Understanding timing's importance doesn't guarantee correct decisions. Strategic mistakes occur—Looppanel prioritized product excellence over monetization longer than optimal. Emotional decisions also create regret.

The author discovered that obsessing over past mistakes proves counterproductive. Instead, journaling provided therapeutic value for managing emotional responses to setbacks. Reflection helps; rumination hurts.

Personal relationships suffered during the startup's early years. The author's introverted nature, combined with pandemic conditions and writing obligations, created distance from friends and family. Acceptance means acknowledging mistakes while redirecting energy toward forward progress.

## Good things take time

Rapid growth narratives dominate startup culture, yet research suggests first-time founders face their toughest period between 18-36 months. Looppanel's strongest year came in 2024, built on foundations established years earlier through accumulated failures and learning.

The author acknowledges needing years to develop skills in product thinking and user empathy—capabilities that seemed obvious only in retrospect. Patience proved essential; immediate results rarely materialize.

## Summing up

While hard work receives frequent praise in professional contexts, persistence remains underrated, particularly in startups. The best outcomes emerge from sustained effort combined with strategic timing awareness.

Startup experience teaches recognizing when to act, accepting unchangeable circumstances, and maintaining determination when results remain invisible. These principles apply equally to personal development and business building.
