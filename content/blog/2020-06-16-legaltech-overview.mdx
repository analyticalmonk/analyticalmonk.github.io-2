## Background

Emerging technologies like mobile, data analytics, and machine learning have transformed retail and healthcare, yet law remains an industry where technology is only beginning to create meaningful impact. The author researched the field to identify opportunities for technological advancement, focusing on understanding technology adoption and the broader ecosystem.

## Need for LegalTech

LegalTech refers to "the use of technology and software to provide legal services and support the legal industry." Rather than replacing lawyers, the field's primary promise involves:

- Enhancing practitioners' work and professional quality of life
- Expanding access to legal services for ordinary citizens and small businesses

Technology can reduce costs and increase efficiency, potentially benefiting all participants.

## Breaking Down Law

Three categories of LegalTech users exist:

1. **Administrators of law**
2. **Practitioners of law**
3. **Users of law**

A key distinction exists between practicing law (requiring legal education and expertise) and providing legal services (tasks that non-lawyers can perform, like incorporating companies or filing patents).

## Prologue: Technology in Law

Non-specialized software already impacts the legal field:

- Video conferencing adoption accelerated due to COVID-19
- Judiciary faces network infrastructure challenges
- Office suites support document drafting and cloud collaboration

## LegalTech in Action

The Stanford CodeX Techindex identifies nine LegalTech categories:

- **Marketplace:** Connects lawyers, students, and users (Upcounsel, Vakilsearch)
- **Document automation:** Customizes and automates legal documents (Legito)
- **Practice management:** Streamlines workflows (Clio)
- **Legal Research:** Organizes legal information (Casetext, Manupatra, Indiankanoon)
- **Legal Education:** Provides classes and training
- **Online Dispute Resolution:** Enables online mediation and arbitration (Sama, Presolv360)
- **E-discovery:** Procures electronic information for legal proceedings
- **Analytics:** Generates insights and predicts outcomes (Lex Machina)
- **Compliance:** Monitors regulatory adherence (Arachnys)

## Conclusion

Stakeholder collaboration across multiple levels is essential for LegalTech to realize its potential. Judiciary infrastructure must improve, practitioners and technologists must collaborate, and legal education must evolve. While LegalTech is gaining traction in the West through venture capital investment, India remains in early stages. Initiatives like Agami and Prarambh indicate promising development ahead.
